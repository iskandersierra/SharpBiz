# SharpBiz

SharpBiz is going to be a materialization of ideas and methods learned by me and hopefully others around the concepts of Domain-Driven Design, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Web API, Messaging and Asynchronous Architecture.

Subjects to be aware about:
---------------------------
* Domain-Driven Design
* Command-Query Responsibility Segregation/Separation
* Event Sourcing
* Asynchronous Message Driven Architecture (My own words)
* Declarative Programming
* Behavior-Driven Development
* Task-oriented User Interface
* Web API and HTTP aware API
* XACM and Attribute Based Access Control
* Claim Based Access Control
* OAuth2 and OpenID Connect
* Distributed Application Development
* High Availability Services
* Strong and Eventual Consistency

Around these and other subject I will be adding documentation, references, code and my own thoughts.
